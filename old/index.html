            <p>I am 29 years old, currently in middle of changing work fields thanks to my friends, who finally pushed
                me over. Hopefully for the better.</p>
            <p>I went to university for 6 years, been working as security guard and bus driver since. In my free time I
                play games, guitar, work on improving our home and DIY and play with my RC stuff.</p>
