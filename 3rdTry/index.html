            <h2>Projects I worked on</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>Talent.pm</h3>
                    <a href="https://talent.pm/" class="site-link">Link to website</a>
                    <p>
                        Talent.pm is website designed for freelancers to offer their services. It can be really
                        anything,
                        from repairs, cooking, writing essays to chatting, calling or teaching subjects.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Site is created with the use of Next.js framework using TypeScript, hosted on Vercel. We were
                        team of 5 people and it was our project phase project during bootcamp.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Together with Next.js, we used tailwind to write CSS, NextAuth to get authentication and
                        authorization solution. On top of that, we used both MySQL and MongoDB to store most of the site
                        data. MongoDB is being used for messaging system only, while MySQL stores information about
                        users, their offers and also what did they buy or someone bought from them. Session is database
                        driven.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We used ORM to connect to databases, instead of writing our queries. For MongoDB we used
                        Mongoose and for MySQL we did choose Prisma. We also used testing frameworks: Jest for
                        unit-testing and Cypress for end-to-end testing.

                    <h3>Green Bay</h3>
                    <a href="https://zelwake-green-bay.vercel.app/" class="site-link">Link to website</a>
                    <a href="https://github.com/zelwake/green-bay" class="git-link">Link to github repo</a>
                    <p>
                        Green Bay was project that we got as preparation for final exam at bootcamp. We were to create a
                        clone of eBay, where user could create profile, have some credits, put something up for sell and
                        also buy stuff.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Site was created using Next.js framework using TypeScript and it was a solo project.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We had to use SQL queries as a preparation for final exam so no ORM is used in this project. For
                        CSS I once again opted to tailwind, since I touched it very lightly during Talent project.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Information about users is store inside database but authentication/authorization is handled
                        with JWT this time, to practice both login methods.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each newly created user has credit of 300 and at this moment, there is no way to increase this
                        amount. Whenever someone buys a thing, this item will be hidden from front-page list, yet on
                        it's product page, a buyer can now be seen. That's all the functionality of this project at this
                        moment.
                    </p>
